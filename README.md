Arch Maintain System - one solution to rule them all.

### Planned feature list
* Highly configurable backup system using rsync
* Updating and maintaining packages
* ... and other cool stuff.

Ambitious. But...
Currently backup and update features are implemented (and they are even working, surptise). Maybe you want to help and to be my guide?

## Installation
Clone this repo and you already rock.

## Using
Make your own `config.py` using `example_config.py` as an example.
Run `./run.py -h` for available options.
